If you are stuck, **consider Google as your best friend**. If you are facing an issue, it is highly likely that someone else has previously faced the same issue as well.

This is how you are supposed to do it on a software engineering job as well. If Google is unable to help, **ask on the official communication channel** (in our case, slack).

Learn how to search for things the right way. Let's look at some of the best practices:

*   If it is an error, **copy the exact error message and search for it** . If the error message is very big then try to find the part which is most likely unique to your issue. This is generally the error or exception code or type.
*   If it is some other issue and not an error then **search for that specific issue** . Don't search for something general like 'object update not working'. A specific query would be 'javascript function not updating object'. It could be more specific based on the use case.
*   **Always mention the language or technology name at the beginning of your query** . Google will most likely suggest your exact query even before you type it completely.
*   If you want to learn how to do something, **mention the language/technology followed by your** **exact specific query** . Example: 'javascript how to insert element in array at specific index'.
*   Let's say you want to search only on stackoverflow, **add 'site:stackoverflow.com'** **after your query** .
*   There are certain best practices. You will figure them out once you start treating Google as your best friend.

**Do not search for solutions to PS/DSA question on Google** . You are supposed to progress with a hint and not the solution. Consider your TA and community as your best friend there!

**Always be willing to search and learn more about stuff you find interesting** . This will give you depth about things you feel passionate about. It can be a topic that you can talk for long during the Hiring Manager round. Passion is considered a very good skill.

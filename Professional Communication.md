These tips are based on how software engineers work in product-based companies. We want you to follow the same during the bootcamp as well. 
- Prefer async communication vs sync communication. Do not send a hi and wait for the other person to reply before asking your question.
- Respect the time of others. Provide maximum context in your messages/emails. Assume that the other person only has 30 seconds to resolve your doubt.
- Help one another. The best way to learn something is to teach it to others. Try to help others in doubt resolution. That being said, do it only if you've time for that.
- Be very open to receive and give feedback (good/bad). Understand that everything is happening to help you succeed. Take feedback and improve on those. Give feedback to make sure that the processes improve and help you succeed.
- Be a good listener. If someone is asking you something then there is a reason behind it. So, do not ignore those points while getting your doubt resolved or during mentorship. 
- Learn in public. There will be stand-ups where you will have to mention what you've worked on. It will help you stay accountable. Be honest with what you've done. 
- When in doubt, ask. Do not assume anything. If you've any doubts or want to know something, ask on the slack.

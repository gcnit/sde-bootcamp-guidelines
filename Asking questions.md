# How to ask questions the right way?

Weâ€™d love to help you. To improve your chances of getting your doubts resolved as soon as possible, here are some of the best practices that you should follow while asking a question:

## Search and Research
- Spend some time debugging the issue yourself. Debugging is an essential skill of a software engineer. Do not waste a lot of time though if you feel you are not moving in the right direction.
- Google is your best friend. Can you find the answer to your question with a simple google search? If yes then try to get it resolved using Google.
- If not, has it been discussed in one of the courses or live classes? Look for it in the relevant section or recording.
- If it has not been answered then it is the right time to ask question.

## Write a title that summarizes the specific problem
- This should be a self-sufficient 1-liner about your doubt. It should not be the name of the assessment/problem/section.
- Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence.
  - What details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem?
  - Include any error messages, or issues that can help your someone resolve your question ASAP.
- If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last. Sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.
- Examples of titles:
  - Bad: C# Math Confusion
  - Good: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?
  - Bad: [php] session doubt
  - Good: How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?
  - Bad: android if else problems
  - Good: Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?

## Provide as much information as possible in the description
- Keep the messages descriptive and provide as much information as possible.
- In the description, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title.
- This should describe your doubt including your approach till now and what exactly your doubt is.
- Mentioning "did not understand something" or "unable to solve, please check" is not sufficient and would always require a message asking for more details in the next message.
- Providing maximum context in the doubt will help your doubt get resolved faster due to less back-and-forth.
- In some cases, you will be able to resolve your doubt while writing the description itself. Include anything that may help us better understand the doubt.

## Provide relevant links
- Mention the link of the course section or problem so that the resolver can just click on the link and understand what you are talking about. Mentioning just the name is not sufficient.
- Mention the link of your code instead of copy pasting your code. The resolver should be able to run your code directly. This is extremely important.
  - Use workat.tech/ide for DSA-related doubts.
  - Use repl.it for Development-related doubts.

## Other Guidelines
- We **encourage the community to help one another** as much as possible. That will help you a lot in solidifying your learning. It will also help us better understand your learnings.
- **While you're helping someone resolve a doubt make sure that you're asking questions and not answering.** The idea is to provide direction to the asker's thought process instead of providing data which the person will not be able to retain.
- Please **avoid sending the same doubt multiple times** to get it resolved faster. Any doubt that you submit will be assigned to the TAs and they will be resolving all the assigned doubts on the same day itself.
- Please **do not ask a doubt on personal messages** since the doubt needs to be assigned to any of the TA. Also, keeping the doubt public might encourage the community to ask doubts and also to solve your doubts.

## Doubt Template
Please make sure to include the following details while asking a doubt:
- **Title**: This should be a self-sufficient 1-liner about your doubt. It should not be the name of the assessment/problem/section
- **Description**: This should describe your doubt including your approach till now and what exactly your doubt is. Mentioning "did not understand something" or "unable to solve, please check" is not sufficient and would always require a message asking for more details in the next message. Providing the same in the doubt will help your doubt get resolved faster due to less back-and-forth. In some cases, you will be able to resolve your doubt while writing the description itself. Include anything that may help us better understand the doubt.
- **Link**: This should include the link to the problem/assessment/section where you are facing the issue. Mentioning just the name is not sufficient.
- **Code Link**: If you're facing a doubt in a code then copy your code to https://workat.tech/ide or https://repl.it. Test it, save it and share the link here.

## Slack Best Practices
Please follow the following best practices to keep the channel organized, to reduce the number of notifications that you receive for unrelated doubts and also to reduce the doubt resolution time.
- Make sure to send a single message for a single doubt. Use Shift+Enter for a new line instead of Enter to avoid creating new messages for every new line.
- Send a new message to the channel only for new doubts. Use threads for replying to existing doubts. You can click on the message and then click on 'Add a reply' to reply as part of a thread. Avoid selecting 'Also send to channel' while replying otherwise a notification will be sent to everyone in the channel.
